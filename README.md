# Developer Notes:

compile: (may take a while initially)

```
git clone ...
./build.sh
```
run:
```
build/main
```


### Structure:
<ol>
<li>any files with .c are in the src/ directory</li>
<li>any files with .h and libraries are in the lib/ directory</li>
<li>any binary files go in build (this is ignored by git)</li>
</ol>

### Rules:
<ol>
<li> When editing code, please work on a new branch and then create a pull request
which will be reviewed
</ol>
